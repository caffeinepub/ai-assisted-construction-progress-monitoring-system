# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a professional dashboard UI for an AI-assisted construction progress monitoring system with mock data.

**Planned changes:**
- Create Login page with centered card layout, email/password fields, and login button
- Create Dashboard page with sidebar navigation, top navbar, statistics cards (Total Projects, Active Projects, Last Updated Project), and projects table
- Create Upload Progress page with form for project selection, building count, construction stage dropdown, and drag-and-drop image upload area
- Create Project Details page with project header, stage badge, progress display, timeline graph placeholder, image gallery, and comparison section
- Build reusable components: Card, Button (primary/secondary variants), Alert (error/success states), and responsive Sidebar
- Use Tailwind CSS with deep blue primary color and gray secondary color throughout
- Implement responsive design for all pages using mobile-first approach
- Organize components in structured folder hierarchy with clean, functional React components

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate through a professional construction monitoring dashboard with login page, main dashboard showing project statistics and table, upload progress form, and detailed project views with progress tracking and image galleries - all populated with mock data.
