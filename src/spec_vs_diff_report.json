  "summary": "The implementation provides a comprehensive construction monitoring dashboard with all core React components and pages. The Login, Dashboard, Upload Progress, and Project Details pages are implemented with appropriate UI components (Card, Button, Alert, Sidebar). All components use Tailwind CSS with deep blue (#1e3a8a) and gray color schemes. Mock data is used throughout. Components are functional and organized in a structured folder hierarchy. The diff shows complete implementation of all seven requirements with appropriate routing, responsive design, and reusable component architecture.",
